# GUI Edition
Currently being worked on. Started development 9+ months after the initial release of the original command line SVA.
Aims to:
    - Provide a graphical user interface (GUI). The original used a command line which isn't very appealing, particularly to the general public. The addition of a GUI will make use of the program far simpler and faster.
    - Overhaul calculation algorithms. Found some errors in the original and so this edition will try to create a correct algorithm.

### Requirements
In order to compile from source code, the following module(s) are required:
    - tkinter

### Improvements
    - Add calculation for trees
    - Add calculation for livestock
    - Allow input for fertilizer
